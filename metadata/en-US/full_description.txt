Mindful Notifier is a simple mindfulness-based app which displays a
notification reminder at user-configurable intervals. It is another
take on a 'Mindfulness Bell', with the addition of accompanying text
to provide added context to the mindfulness reminder.

The reminders are taken from a configurable list, and are chosen
at random at each interval. The reminder interval can either
be periodic (in intervals aligned to the top of the hour, down 
to a 15 minute granularity) or random (between a selected range 
of minutes).

Some default reminders are provided as examples. You can add,
edit, or remove these default reminders as you like.

There are 5 different bells included, and you can also configure
your own custom bell from your phone's local storage.

This app works very well in conjunction with a smartwatch. In
this mode you can also mute the bell to have silent mindfulness
prompts throughout your day.
